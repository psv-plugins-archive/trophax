# TropHAX 1.0
https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/trophax/downloads/trophax1.0.suprx

# Readme


# Installation
1. Put trophax.suprx into  ux0:tai (or ur0:tai if u prefer)
2. Edit the config.txt file in that same 'tai' folder
3. At the bottom of config.txt put *ALL to use it on all games (or u can use a games titleid specifically)
4. Underneath that put in ux0:tai/trophax2.0.suprx (or ur0:tai/trophax2.0.suprx if you use sd2vita/just like plugins on ur0)
5. Reload your henkaku configuration file from HENKAKU SETTINGS

# Usage 

You must install the plugin (obviously), it is your choice whether to use the *TITLEID or *ALL, it should not load on system apps, if you experience otherwise, please report.

After the plugin is installed, start up the desired game and once at the main menu hit Start+Select to enable the plugin.
Now you can use L+R to unlock all or L+START to unlock a specific trophy, use L+UP and L+DOWN to make your selection
then L+CIRCLE to unlock

Trophys will sync online. so there is a potential ban risk
use a different account, or simply use offline if you care.

# License
Licensed Under GPL- but:
You are absoutley under no circumstance allowed to use this for commercial gain in a "Trophy Service"
Where you sell trophys to users. its ok to do it in a FREE Trophy Service. but not in a paid one.
